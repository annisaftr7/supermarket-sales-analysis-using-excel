# Supermarket Sales Analysis Using Excel

## Introduction
In recent months, a supermarket in Myanmar has encountered revenue fluctuations. I examined the dataset to gain insights with the goal of improving efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability. My objective was to grasp insights into the following aspects:
1. The most frequently used payment method
2. Ratings provided by customers
3. Time with the highest number of products purchased
4. Gross income by category

## Project Workflow
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean and format the data to ensure it is accurate and consistent.
- **Data Exploration and Analysis**: Analyze the data to understand its characteristics and extract insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visually appealing and interactive dashboards to make insights more understandable and accessible.

## Key Findings
- **Most frequently used payment methods**: E-wallet emerges as the most frequently utilized payment method, totaling 345 transactions. This aligns with the findings of a survey conducted by Visa, where preference for cashless payments continues to grow, and nearly four in five (77%) Southeast Asian consumers plan to use cashless payments more often. The rise in the adoption of cashless payments is driven by various factors, including safer transaction (59%), greater convenience and less hassle (56%), and ease of tracking financial records (53%) (Visa, 2022).

- **Ratings provided by customers**: Understanding these ratings can help supermarkets identify popular and well-liked products as well as those that may need improvement. By focusing on both maintaining the high standards of top-rated categories and addressing the issues in lower-rated categories, the supermarket can significantly elevate customer satisfaction and drive better business outcomes.

- **Time with the highest number of products purchased**: The analysis reveals that each branch shows unique customer purchasing patterns, with common peaks around 19:00 and significant dips around 16:00. Understanding the time with the highest number of products purchased is crucial for improving customer service, optimizing operations, managing inventory, and increasing sales and revenue in supermarkets.

- **Gross Income by Category**: It is important for supermarkets to analyze gross income by category in order to make decisions that can improve sales, profitability, and customer satisfaction. According to the analysis, the health and beauty category has the highest gross income, totaling $7,830,172. This indicates that health and beauty products are popular among customers and significantly contribute to the overall revenue.

## Recommendation
1. Devise strategies to optimize visits on less crowded hours such as the discounts or other special offers. Organize product stock adjustments to accommodate increased demand on peak hours, ensuring that popular products are easily available. This can prevent stock-outs and improve customer satisfaction.
2. Initiate customer feedback surveys to make sure if the current benefits align with customer needs, adjust special offers based on buying pattern or buying behavior, and provide training to staff to ensure the optimal service to customers.
3. By allocating resources to brand promotion and customer engagement initiatives, companies can enhance brand loyalty and further solidify the appeal of their top-selling products. This can be achieved through various marketing strategies such as targeted advertising, social media engagement, loyalty programs, and personalized customer interactions.
4. In order to improve the performance of underperforming products, it's important to integrate customer feedback into the product development process. By actively seeking and incorporating customer feedback, businesses can refine their products to better meet the needs and expectations of their target audience. Additionally, adjusting pricing strategies can help enhance competitiveness in the market without sacrificing profitability.
