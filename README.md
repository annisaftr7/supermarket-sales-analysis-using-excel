# Supermarket Sales Analysis Using Excel

## Introduction
In recent months, a supermarket in Myanmar has encountered revenue fluctuations. I examined the dataset to gain insights with the goal of improving efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability. My objective was to grasp insights into the following aspects:
1. The most frequently used payment method
2. Ratings provided by customers
3. Time with the highest number of products purchased
4. Gross income by category

## Project Workflow
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Clean and format the data to ensure it is accurate and consistent.
- **Data Exploration and Analysis**: Analyze the data to understand its characteristics and extract insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Create visually appealing and interactive dashboards to make insights more understandable and accessible.

## Key Findings
- **Most frequently used payment methods**: E-wallet emerges as the most frequently utilized payment method, totaling 345 transactions. This aligns with the findings of a survey conducted by Visa, where preference for cashless payments continues to grow, and nearly four in five (77%) Southeast Asian consumers plan to use cashless payments more often. The rise in the adoption of cashless payments is driven by various factors, including safer transaction (59%), greater convenience and less hassle (56%), and ease of tracking financial records (53%) (Visa, 2022).
