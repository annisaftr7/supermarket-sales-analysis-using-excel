# Supermarket Sales Analysis Using Excel

## Introduction
In recent months, a supermarket in Myanmar has encountered revenue fluctuations. I examined the dataset to gain insights with the goal of improving efficiency, customer satisfaction, and overall profitability. My objective was to grasp insights into the following aspects:
1. The most frequently used payment method
2. Ratings provided by customers
3. Time with the highest number of products purchased
4. Gross income by category
